      <h1>Life of a Starfish</h1>
       <p>
         <img src="image/starfish.jpg"> Starfish, unique to most animals, have five arms that spread from a centralized disk, providing it a beautiful star-like appearance. The capacity of starfish to grow more arms is one wonderful quality. Starfish are great masters of regeneration because they are capable of creating a new arm if one is lost due to harm or attack. Their strong arms and tube feet can be used to break apart shells, particularly those of clams and mussels. The starfish splits up its shell and pushes its stomach into its prey, where it physically digests it. These fascinating creatures are attractive because they come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and vibrant colors. Starfish have an amazing range of shapes, from little species with beautiful patterns to big ones with spiky bodies. As feeders that are Mollusks, crustaceans, and other tiny underwater creatures make up nearly all of the diet of starfish. The starfish splits up its shell and pushes its stomach into its prey, where it physically digests it. They have a special way to eat that entails utilizing their tube feet to break apart their food's shells and moving their stomachs to digest what they eat externally. They are able to consume animals that they are unable to obtain.
